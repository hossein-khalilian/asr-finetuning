# USAGE: python process_asr_text_tokenizer.py --manifest=<path to train manifest files, seperated by commas> \
#         --data_root="<output directory>" \
#         --vocab_size=<number of tokens in vocabulary> \
#         --tokenizer=<"spe" or "wpe"> \
#         --log
# where <manifest> can be: train_clean_100, train_clean_360, train_other_500
# You can also put more than one data_set comma-separated:
# --manifest="train_clean_100,train_clean_360,train_other_500"
# or
#       python process_asr_text_tokenizer.py --data_file=<path to train text file> \
#         --data_root="<output directory>" \
#         --vocab_size=<number of tokens in vocabulary> \
#         --tokenizer=<"bpe" or "wpe"> \
#         --log
# where <manifest> can be: train_clean_100, train_clean_360, train_other_500
# You can also put more than one data_set comma-separated:
# --manifest="train_clean_100,train_clean_360,train_other_500"
#
# Args:
#   --manifest or --data_file: If your text data lies inside of an ASR manifest file,
#       then use the --manifest path. If instead the text data is inside a file with separate lines
#       corresponding to different text lines, then use --data_file.
#       In either case, you can add commas to concatenate different manifests or different data files.
#
#   --data_root: The output directory (whose subdirectories will be created if not present) where
#       the tokenizers will be placed.
#
#   --vocab_size: The size of the tokenizer vocabulary. Larger vocabularies can accommodate almost entire,
#       words but the decoder size of any model will grow proportionally.
#
#   --tokenizer: Can be either spe or wpe . spe refers to the Google sentencepiece library tokenizer.
#       wpe refers to the HuggingFace BERT Word Piece tokenizer.
#
#   --no_lower_case: When this flag is passed, it will force the tokenizer to create seperate tokens for
#       upper and lower case characters. By default, the script will turn all the text to lower case
#       before tokenization (and if upper case characters are passed during training/inference, the
#       tokenizer will emit a token equivalent to Out-Of-Vocabulary). Used primarily for the
#       English language.
#
#    --spe_type: The sentencepiece library has a few implementations of the tokenization technique, and
#       spe_type refers to these implementations. Currently supported types are unigram, bpe, char, word.
#       Defaults to bpe.
#
#   --spe_character_coverage: The sentencepiece library considers how much of the original vocabulary it
#       should cover in its "base set" of tokens (akin to the lower and upper case characters of the
#       English language). For almost all languages with small base token sets (<1000 tokens), this
#       should be kept at its default of 1.0. For languages with larger vocabularies (say Japanese,
#       Mandarin, Korean etc), the suggested value is 0.9995.
#
#   --spe_user_defined_symbols: The sentencepiece library allows you to add your own tokens to the base set.
#      This flag allows you to pass a space separated list of tokens that you want to add to the base set.
#      These tokens remain in the decoded text and are encoded automatically when present in the input text.
#
#   --spe_control_symbols: The sentencepiece library allows you to add your own tokens to the base set.
#      This flag allows you to pass a space separated list of tokens that you want to add to the base set.
#      These tokens get removed at decode time and are not encoded from the text - can only be added to the
#      input programatically.
#
#   --spe_byte_fallback: If <unk>, fallback to a byte sequence of the characters.
#
#   --spe_split_digits: If true, digits are split into individual tokens.
#
#   --spe_sample_size: If the dataset is too large, consider using a sampled dataset indicated by a
#       positive integer. By default, any negative value (default = -1) will use the entire dataset.
#
#   --spe_train_extremely_large_corpus: When training a sentencepiece tokenizer on very large amounts of text,
#       sometimes the tokenizer will run out of memory or wont be able to process so much data on RAM.
#       At some point you might receive the following error - "Input corpus too large, try with
#       train_extremely_large_corpus=true". If your machine has large amounts of RAM, it might still be possible
#       to build the tokenizer using the above flag. Will silently fail if it runs out of RAM.
#
#   --spe_max_sentencepiece_length: Limits the maximum length that any any SentencePiece subword can be.
#       Using this will change the subword tokens generated.
#
#   --spe_pad: Adds <pad> as special token.
#
#   --spe_bos: Adds <s> as Begining-of-Sentence special token.
#
#   --spe_eos: Adds </s> as End-of-Sentence special token.
#
#   --log: Whether the script should display log messages
